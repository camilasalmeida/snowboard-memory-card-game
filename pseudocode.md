# Pseudocode for the Snowboard-Themed Memory Card Game:

1. Define any variables used to track the state of the game:
    * Flipped Cards
    * The match result
    * Cards left to click
    * The result message
    * Initial timer
    * Timer left
  
2. Define the required constants:
    * Board
    * Cards Value, will be an array of cards (images related to snowboarding, gear and etc)
    * Matched Cards

3. Initialize the game:
    * Create a board, generate card elements and append them to the board
    * Each card should have a front (with a generic snowboard icon) and back face (with specific snowboard, gear, images)
    * Add a snowfall effect to the game by selecting the snowfall element
    * Using the DOM, generate and animate snowflake elements

4.  Handle player actions:
     * When a player clicks on a card, add the card to `flippedCards`
     * If two cards are flipped, proceed to compare them
    * Update the DOM to reflect the flipped state of the cards (showing the snowboard-themed images)

5. Compare the flipped cards and check for a match

6. Check if the game is win/lose, render a win/lose message to the player.
